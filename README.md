## encrypted-client    
    
This is the client counterpart to the encrypted-server project. This application establishes a connection with the server and attemps to securely communicate with the server process.    
    
To run the code, you must compile into a jar file and then run the command...    
```
java -jar jarname.jar arg0 arg1   
```    
...where arg0 is the IP address of the server process and arg1 is the port number that the server process is listening on.
